# Portfolio Optimization by using Genetic Algorithm
Buying and selling stocks is a very interesting thing. Because stocks can make investors get big profits, but vice versa. To get a big profit, investors need to analyze in predicting stock prices. However, predicting stock prices is a difficult thing to do because stock prices fluctuate rapidly all the time. So that investors need to predict the stock price as short as possible.

Portfolio optimization method is one of the areas that attract the most attention and arouse curiosity in the financial field. Mathematicians and statisticians have regularly tried to find the ideal solution on this topic. This optimization method has been possible since the use of the genetic algorithm. A model was developed using specific stock market data.
